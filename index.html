    <h2>Hello.</h2>
    <p class="description">An independent and self-motivated person looking for an entry-level position in the
                Data Science / Programming department where I can utilize the knowledge I have gained during my courses.
                Well versed in Pandas, API requests, and GUI interfaces.
                I am eager to learn always more and truly passionate about programing and coding.</p>

      <h3>Python</h3>
      <p>Being a self-taught Python developer is not an easy task.
          It took a lot of investigation to get the best information to learn out of all the sources I could find.
      I had to really carve my way into learning this programming language, all with consistency and persistence.
      I really fell in love with this language, adding to my already portfolio of web developer kit, also self-taught.</p>

      <img class="database-img" src="database.png" alt="second-skills-img">
      <h3>SQL</h3>
      <p>Complementing very well the python skill, I also decided to focus on learning SQL after.
      All the data scientist roles that I'm trying to land do require it, and it makes sense to learn this two amazing skills.
      Joining it later to my Excel expertise from jobs I already had it really comes in handy to establish a good skill set for a future Data Scientist role.</p>
